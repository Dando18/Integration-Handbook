\chapter*{Preface}
Integration is usually taught in first semester calculus, but can take years to master and understand nuances. This book tries to capture different techniques involved in calculating integrals and the intricacies of choosing a method of attack.

\section*{Prerequisites}
The content of this book assumes basic knowledge of  algebra, differential/integral calculus, and real/complex analysis.


\section*{Structure of book}
% You might want to add short description about each chapter in this book.
Each method discussed will be broken into four parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intuition
    \item Definition
    \item Example
    \item Practice
\end{itemize}

% Give credit where credit is due. %
% Say thanks!                      %
